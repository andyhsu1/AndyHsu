            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in Computer Science while also pursing a certificate in Applied Statistical Modeling. I come
                from Katy, TX where I graduated from Seven Lakes High School. I am currently seeking a Software Engineering internship for the Summer of 2022.
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Some of my hobbies include reading, playing sports (basketball, volleyball, spikeball, etc.), cooking, and playing the drums.
                I love traveling, trying out new things, and just being active. As the COVID-19 pandemic is coming to an end, I cannot wait to meet people in-person and
                 attend in-person events again. If we have not met, feel free to contact me at any time. Let's stay in touch!!
            </p>
